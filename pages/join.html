<p>I am looking for students and postdocs interested in exploring oceanic fluid dynamics and ecological processes in aquatic microbial ecosystems as well as questions related to reaction-advection-diffusion systems and ecological networks. Students will have the opportunity to gain experience with mathematical modeling, ocean observations, and molecular ecology techniques. Students can come from a variety of backgrounds (a mathematical background is not necessarily required and neither is experience in oceanography).</p>

<p>If you are interested in learning more, please send an email to Dr Mara Freilich (mara_freilich@brown.edu) that includes your CV, information on your background (including education, coursework, and any previous research experience), your interests, and your future career goals.</p>

<p> <H3> Brown University undergraduate students </H3> </p>
<p> Brown University undergraduate students are welcome to contact Dr Mara Freilich about getting involved in research on any of the topics listed on the <a href = "https://mara-freilich.github.io/research"> research </a> page or related topics. </p>

<p> <H3> PhD students </H3> </p>
<p> Students apply to the graduate program in either <a href = "https://appliedmath.brown.edu/academics/graduate-program/prospective-phd-students">Applied Math</a> or <a href = "https://deeps.brown.edu/graduate"> Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences</a> for fall 2024 with applications due in December-January. Note that applications requesting a fee waiver will be due 2 weeks prior to the listed applications deadline. Students who are accepted to the PhD program will be fully funded with a stipend of $42,412 per year (2022-2023) and benefits. This funding will include a mix of fellowships, research assistantships, and teaching assistantships. </p>

<p> Brown University Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences participates in the <a href = "https://www.agu.org/bridge-program">AGU Bridge Program</a>. Applications are due by March 15.</p>


<p> <H3> Postdoc positions </H3> </p>
<p> Prospective postdocs are encouraged to reach out to discuss research interests. Prospective postdocs are highly encouraged to develop their own research projects in collaboration with Mara and to seek funding for those projects through fellowships.
