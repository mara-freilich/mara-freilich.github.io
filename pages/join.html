<p>I am looking for students and postdocs interested in exploring oceanic fluid dynamics and ecological processes in ocean microbial ecosystems as well as questions related to reaction-advection diffusion systems and ecological networks. Students will have the opportunity to gain experience with mathematical modeling, ocean observations, and molecular ecology techniques. Students can come from a variety of backgrounds (a mathematical background is not necessarily required and neither is experience in lab work).

If you are interested in learning more, please send an email to Dr Mara Freilich that includes your CV, information on your background (including education, coursework, and any previous research experience), your interests, and your future career goals. Students apply to the graduate program in either Applied Math or Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences for fall 2023. </p>
