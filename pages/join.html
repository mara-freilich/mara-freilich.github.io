<p>I am looking for students and postdocs interested in exploring oceanic fluid dynamics and ecological processes in ocean microbial ecosystems as well as questions related to reaction-advection diffusion systems and ecological networks. Students will have the opportunity to gain experience with mathematical modeling, ocean observations, and molecular ecology techniques. Students can come from a variety of backgrounds (a mathematical background is not necessarily required and neither is experience in lab work).</p>

<p>If you are interested in learning more, please send an email to Dr Mara Freilich that includes your CV, information on your background (including education, coursework, and any previous research experience), your interests, and your future career goals.</p>

<p> <H3> PhD students </H3> </p>
<p> Students apply to the graduate program in either <a href = "https://appliedmath.brown.edu/academics/graduate-program/prospective-phd-students">Applied Math</a> or <a href = "https://deeps.brown.edu/graduate"> Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences</a> for fall 2023. Students who are accepted to the PhD program will be fully funded with a stipend of $42,412 per year (2022-2023). This funding will include a mix of fellowships, research assistanceships, and teachnig assistanceships. </p>


<p> <H3> Postdoc positions </H3> </p>
<p> We will likely open a specific postdoc position in spring 2023. In the meantime, prospective postdocs are encouraged to reach out to discuss research interests. </p>

<p> Prospective postdocs are also highly encouraged to develop their own research projects in collaboration with Mara and to seek funding for those projects through fellowships. Please reach out if you are interested in applying for a fellowship to work with my research group. Some potential fellowships include: </p>
