<p>I am looking for students and postdocs interested in exploring oceanic fluid dynamics and ecological processes in aquatic microbial ecosystems as well as questions related to reaction-advection-diffusion systems and ecological networks. Students will have the opportunity to gain experience with mathematical modeling, ocean observations, and molecular ecology techniques. Students can come from a variety of backgrounds (a mathematical background is not necessarily required and neither is experience in oceanography).</p>

<p>I am recruiting a postdoc to study eddy carbon fluxes using observations and models.</p>

<p>If you are interested in learning more, please send an email to Dr Mara Freilich (mara_freilich@brown.edu) that includes your CV, information on your background (including education and previous research experience), your interests, and your future career goals. Prospective graduate students should include an unofficial transcript or other information about coursework.</p>

<p> <H3> PhD students </H3> </p>
<p> Students apply to the graduate program in either <a href = "https://appliedmath.brown.edu/academics/graduate-program/prospective-phd-students">Applied Math</a> or <a href = "https://deeps.brown.edu/graduate"> Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences</a> for fall 2025 with applications due in December-January. Note that applications requesting a fee waiver will be due 2 weeks prior to the listed applications deadline. Students who are accepted to the PhD program will be fully funded with a stipend of $49,012 per year (2024-2025) and benefits. This funding will include a mix of fellowships, research assistantships, and teaching assistantships. I am unlikely to recruit a PhD student in EEPS for fall 2025. The Applied Math program is direct admission and it is not necessary to contact prospective advisors before applying to the Applied Math program.</p>

<p> Brown University Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences participates in the <a href = "https://www.agu.org/bridge-program">AGU Bridge Program</a>. Applications are due by March 15.</p>


<p> <H3> Postdoc positions </H3> </p>
<p> Prospective postdocs are encouraged to reach out to discuss research interests. Prospective postdocs are highly encouraged to develop their own research projects in collaboration with Mara and to seek funding for those projects through fellowships. Please reach out if you are interested in applying for a fellowship to work with my research group. Some potential fellowships include: </p>
