<h4>Teaching</h4>

<p>In Spring 2025 I am be teaching <b>APMA/EEPS 1930P: Mathematics and Climate</b>.
<p> Mathematical models play a critical role in projecting and understanding climate processes. This course will discuss techniques for application of theoretical models, computational experiments, and data analysis in climate science, including oceanic, atmospheric, and ecological phenomena. Intended for students in applied mathematics and other concentrations with quantitative skills who are interested in applying their knowledge to mathematical modeling and climate problems. No previous coursework in climate science is required. Physical science concepts and mathematical techniques will be introduced throughout the course. Students will develop collaborative or individual projects later in the semester.

<p>In Fall 2025 I will be teaching <b>EEPS1400: Climate Modeling I</b>.
<p> An introduction to climate modeling, focusing on the fundamental principles of climate dynamics and the techniques used to simulate and understand the climate system of Earth and other planets. Students will learn about the underlying physics, concepts, and computational methods involved in climate modeling. The course will explore the challenges and uncertainties associated with climate models and their role in predicting future climate change. The course has two tracks: quantitative and qualitative. Students in the quantitative track will gain hands-on experience with analyzing climate modeling output and software tools to do so and will be assessed with problem sets. Students in the qualitative track will focus on interpretation of model results and modeling concepts and have additional reading assignments and will be assessed with writing assignments.


<p><b> I am commited to equitable engagement with the Providence, Rhode Island, and New England communities. If you are community group interested in collaborating, please reach out (<a href="mailto:mara_freilich@brown.edu">mara_freilich@brown.edu</a>) </b>
