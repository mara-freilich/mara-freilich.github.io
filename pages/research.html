    <H4 style="margin-top: 0em;">Bio-physical interactions</H4>
    <p> The fluid environment shapes ocean ecosystems through cascading influences on ecological function, biogeochemical cycles, fisheries, and climate. Oceanic fronts and eddies play an outsized role in global biogeochemical cycling as hotspots of primary production and subduction of carbon and oxygen from the surface to the ocean interior. The influence of eddy and frontal dynamics on ecology and biogeochemical cycles depends on both the pathways of transport and on the ways that microbial communities respond to physical processes. Vertical transport is particularly important because of the large gradients in light and nutrients in the upper ocean. I use process study models and field observations of biogeochemical tracers to improve understanding of submesoscale vertical tracer fluxes and the implications for global biogeochemistry. I study bio-physical processes using idealized modeling, theory, and <a href="https://calypsodri.whoi.edu" target = "_blank">observations</a>. </p>

    <p> <i>Co-chief scientist</i> </p>
    <p> Submesoscale dynamics (1-10 km scales and non-linear dynamics) are uniquely important for ecological processes due to nature of the vertical motion at the submesoscale. My resarch focuses on understanding the mechanisms behind the couplings between submesoscale turbulence and climate dynamics, and the implications for both transfer of energy across scales and for biogeochemical tracer transports. I have been particularly interested in vertical transport, the interactions between waves and eddies, and the use of remote sensing to disentangle physical dynamics. </p>

<p> <i>Co-chief scientist</i> </p>
<p> Species distributions are shaped by rates of physiological processes and species interactions; however, measurements of these rates and interactions are sparse. I tackle this problem by developing mathematical approaches to infer the rates and forms of species interactions from observed species distributions. I am particularly interested in stochastic approaches and using data science tools to interpret environmental data sets. </p>

    <p> Scientists have the fundamental task of being accountable to doing work that improves the lives of people and contributing to overcoming marginalization and injustice. I work with community organizations using a range of methods from science communication to collaborative research. Part of this work involves analysis and action to ensure our science institutions are diverse, equitable, and inclusive. </p>

Because the climate is already changing, we increasingly rely on models to know our environment (yet are confronted with the issue of non-stationarity, so statistical models may fail). Models do not just report on likely conditions; they shape our view of the past, our actions in the present, and the future trajectory.
