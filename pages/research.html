<p>I study the ways that physical oceanographic processes, including fronts and eddies, affect ocean microbial ecology, carbon cycling, and nutrient distributions. My work understanding the link between biological and physical processes involves developing methodologies for modeling ecological processes in the context of environmental variability. I use a range of methods from numerical ocean models to observational work at sea.</p>

<p> I study physical processes using idealized modeling combined with observations. I typically use <a href="https://github.com/PSOM" target = "_blank">PSOM (Process Study Ocean Model)</a> for numerical studies. My <a href="https://mara-freilich.github.io/fieldwork">fieldwork</a> also focuses on frontal dynamics and I have done field campaigns in the Western Mediterranean and at the US Northeast Shelf.</p>
