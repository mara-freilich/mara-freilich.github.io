<p> Oceanic fronts play an outsized role in global biogeochemical cycling as hotspots of primary production and subduction of carbon and oxygen from the surface to the ocean interior. The influence of frontal dynamics on biogeochemical cycles depends on both the pathways of vertical transport and on the ways that microbial communities respond to the enhanced vertical motion at fronts. Submesoscale processes result in large (100s of meters/day), vertical motion on small spatial scales, and have a unique potential to modify ocean ecology and primary production. I use process study models and field observations of biogeochemical tracers to improve understanding of submesoscale vertical tracer fluxes. In my thesis work, I investigate the rate and pathways of exchange between the oceanic mixed layer and thermocline using tracers and Lagrangian particles. Unlike buoyancy, vertical transport of biogeochemical tracers can occur both due to the movement of isopycnals and due to motion along sloping isopycnal.</p>

<p> The response of the phytoplankton community to vertical nutrient fluxes depends on the relative time scales of vertical transport and nutrient uptake and is optimized when the biological timescale matches the vertical velocity frequency. This means that different ocean dynamical regimes are likely to support different phytoplankton growth rates. In observations, biogeochemical tracer fluxes modify the community composition of photosynthetic plankton and productivity both in the vertical and across a strong front. I determine the relative importance of the physical processes of advection and mixing and ecological processes that result in setting the microbial diversity and biomass distribution at strong fronts, which also informs inferences about the subduction rate of biogeochemical tracers. I evaluate the overall importance of frontal subduction and upwelling to biogeochemical cycling by examining changes in the community composition in conjunction with fluxes inferred from physical dynamics and measured respiration rates. </p>

<p> I study physical processes using idealized modeling combined with observations. I typically use <a href="https://github.com/PSOM" target = "_blank">PSOM (Process Study Ocean Model)</a> for numerical studies. My <a href="https://mara-freilich.github.io/fieldwork">fieldwork</a> also focuses on frontal dynamics and I have done field campaigns in the Western Mediterranean as part of the <a href="https://calypsodri.whoi.edu" target = "_blank">Calypso project</a> and at the US Northeast Shelf.</p>
