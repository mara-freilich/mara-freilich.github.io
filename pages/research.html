<p> I study the role of ocean dynamics in the climate system and biosphere through theoretical analysis, high-resolution modeling, and interdisciplinary observations. Projecting and mitigating the impacts of climate change requires predictive understanding of the ways that components of the climate system interact across spatial and temporal scales. My research has four major themes (1) submesoscale dynamics, (2) biophysical interactions, (3) ecological networks, and (4) community-engaged science for climate justice. </p>

<p> <b> Bio-physical interactions </b> The fluid environment shapes ocean ecosystems through cascading influences on ecological function, biogeochemical cycles, fisheries, and climate. Oceanic fronts and eddies play an outsized role in global biogeochemical cycling as hotspots of primary production and subduction of carbon and oxygen from the surface to the ocean interior. The influence of eddy and frontal dynamics on ecology and biogeochemical cycles depends on both the pathways of transport and on the ways that microbial communities respond to physical processes. Vertical transport is particularly important because of the large gradients in light and nutrients in the upper ocean. I use process study models and field observations of biogeochemical tracers to improve understanding of submesoscale vertical tracer fluxes and the implications for global biogeochemistry. I study bio-physical processes using idealized modeling, theory, and <a href="https://calypsodri.whoi.edu" target = "_blank">observations</a>.</p>

<p> <b> Submesoscale dynamics </b> Submesoscale dynamics (1-10 km scales and non-linear dynamics) are uniquely important for ecological processes due to nature of the vertical motion at the submesoscale. My resarch focuses on understanding the mechanisms behind the couplings between submesoscale turbulence and climate dynamics, and the implications for both transfer of energy across scales and for biogeochemical tracer transports. I have been particularly interested in vertical transport, the interactions between waves and eddies, and the use of remote sensing to disentangle physical dynamics. </p>

<p> <b> Ecological networks </b> Species distributions are shaped by rates of physiological processes and species interactions; however, measurements of these rates and interactions are sparse. I tackle this problem by developing mathematical approaches to infer the rates and forms of species interactions from observed species distributions. I am particularly interested in stochastic approaches and using data science tools to interpret environmental data sets.</p>
