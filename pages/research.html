<p> My research has four major themes (1) submesoscale dynamics, (2) biophysical interactions, (3) ecological networks, and (4) community-engaged science for climate justice. </p>

<p> <b> Bio-physical interactions </b> Oceanic fronts and eddies play an outsized role in global biogeochemical cycling as hotspots of primary production and subduction of carbon and oxygen from the surface to the ocean interior. The influence of frontal dynamics on biogeochemical cycles depends on both the pathways of vertical transport and on the ways that microbial communities respond to the enhanced vertical motion at fronts. Submesoscale processes result in large (100s of meters/day), vertical motion on small spatial scales, and have a unique potential to modify ocean ecology and primary production. I use process study models and field observations of biogeochemical tracers to improve understanding of submesoscale vertical tracer fluxes and the implications for global biogeochemistry. </p>

<p> I study bio-physical processes using idealized modeling, <a href="https://calypsodri.whoi.edu" target = "_blank">observations</a>, and theory.</p>
