    <H4 style="margin-top: 0em;">Diego Centeno</H4>
    <p> Diego is a research assistant in the Department of Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences at Brown University. He earned a BA in geosciences at California State University San Bernardino in 2023. He is working on the sulfur cycle in the Salton Sea, including geochemistry and impacts on human health. This work is in collaboration with Isabella Arzeno-Soltero at UCLA, Ryan Sinclair at Loma Linda University, Alianza Coachella Valley, and the Salton Sea Environmental Timeseries. When not doing science, he likes to be outdoors or play guitar. </p>
