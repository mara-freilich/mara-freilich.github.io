    <p> <i>Co-chief scientist</i> </p>
    <p> During a cruise from September 20 to 22, 2019 we studied the ways in which both warm core rings and storms affect the shelfbreak front and the shelf ecosystems. This cruise was also educational, with the entire science party being joint program students. </p>

    <p> <i>Biological sampling lead</i> </p>
    <p> As a collaborator with the Calypso project, I lead sampling of the biological community structure through optical measurements, flow cytometry, 16S sequencing, and respiration rate measurements. The goal of this sampling is to describe and understand the three dimensional pathways that transport biological and biogeochemical tracers including phytoplankton, nutrients, oxygen, and carbon from the surface ocean to the thermocline and from the thermocline to the deep ocean. </p>
