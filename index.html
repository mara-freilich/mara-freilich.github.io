       <p> We study the role of ocean and ecological dynamics in the climate system and biosphere through theoretical analysis, numerical modeling, interdisciplinary observations, and community-engaged research. Projecting and mitigating the impacts of climate change requires predictive understanding of the ways that components of the climate system interact across spatial and temporal scales. </p>

      <p> Our recent <a href = "https://mara-freilich.github.io/research"> research </a> focuses on topics ranging from submesoscale and mesoscale dynamics, physical-biological coupling between ocean ecosystems and physical transport processes, carbon and nutrient cycles in aquatic environments, and the role of scientific information in environmental justice. </p>
