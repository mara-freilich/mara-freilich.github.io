      <p>I study the fluid dynamics of physical oceanographic processes, including fronts and eddies and the ways that these dynamics affect ocean microbial ecology, carbon cycling, and nutrient distributions. My work understanding the link between ecological dynamics and physical environmental processes involves developing methodologies for modeling ecological processes in the context of environmental variability and stochastic frameworks in ecology. I use a range of methods from theory to numerical ocean models to observational work at sea. </p>
