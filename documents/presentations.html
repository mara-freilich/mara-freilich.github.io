    Oceanic fronts play an outsized role in global biogeochemical cycling, serving as hotspots of primary production and subduction of carbon and oxygen from the surface to the ocean interior. The influence of frontal dynamics on biogeochemical cycles depends on both the pathways of vertical transport and on the ways that microbial communities respond to the enhanced vertical motion at fronts. Submesoscale processes result in large (100s of meters/day), surface-enhanced vertical motion on spatial scales O(1km) and have a unique potential to modify ocean ecology and primary production. Using observations from three cruises in the Western Mediterranean, we examine how vertical transport at fronts modifies ecological community composition and productivity both in the vertical and across the front.  We identify and sample vertical intrusions of water generated by up-/down-welling events with depth scales on the order of 100 meters that occurred on timescales of days to weeks. We characterize community composition along water mass trajectories using 16S rRNA gene V1-V2 amplicons (cyanobacteria and eukaryotic phytoplankton plastids) and phytoplankton cell quantification by flow cytometry at high lateral resolution (1-10 km). Along the path of upwelling and subducting water, we observe systematic changes in community composition due to the changing light environment and the differential decay of communities in low-light environments, along with mixing. Subduction enhances deep biodiversity through episodic injections of surface communities and by stirring contrasting microbial communities from either side of the front.

<p>Coherent pathways for vertical transport from the surface mixed layer to ocean interior (APS DFD, November 2020)</p>
<!--
<p><small> The dynamical pathways of subduction, by which water from the oceanic surface mixed layer makes its way into the pycnocline, are influenced by both geostrophic frontogenesis and submesoscale instabilities in the mixed layer.  We explore the pathways and mechanisms for subduction using a submesoscale-resolving numerical model of a mesoscale front. We use particle tracking to identify Lagrangian trajectories that exit the mixed layer and study the evolution of the dynamical properties during subduction from a statistical standpoint. Water parcels subduct within coherent regions along the front. These coherent subduction regions set the ~10 km length scales of the subducted features. As a result, the vertical transport rate of a tracer has a spectrum that is flatter than the spectrum of vertical velocity. Contrary to the forced submesoscale processes that sequester low potential vorticity anomalies in the interior, we find that PV can be elevated in subducting water masses. The rate of subduction that we estimate is of similar magnitude to previous studies (~100 m/year), but the pathways that are unraveled in this study along with the Lagrangian evolution of properties on water parcels, emphasize the role of submesoscale dynamics coupled with mesoscale frontogenesis.</small></p>
